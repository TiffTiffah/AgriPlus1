**Integrated Yield Prediction Crop Management System**

**Overview**
The Integrated Yield Prediction Crop Management System is a web-based application designed to help smallholder farmers in Kenya manage their crops more effectively. By leveraging technology such as Machine Learning and APIs for real-time weather data, the system aims to enhance decision-making, optimize resource use, and ultimately increase crop yields.

**Features**
**Yield Prediction and Recommendations:** Utilizes Machine Learning models to analyze data from soil sensors, crop details, and weather APIs to predict crop yields and provide actionable recommendations.
**Crop Monitoring:** Enables farmers to monitor crops based on collected data, offering suggestions for improving crop quality.
**Weather Monitoring:** Integrates Weather APIs to deliver real-time weather information, including temperature, precipitation, and other essential weather conditions.

**Objectives**
**Main Objective:** To design an integrated yield prediction crop management system.
**Specific Objectives:**
- Integrate weather API for real-time and forecasted weather data collection essential for predicting crop yields and providing insights for decision-making.
- Implement Machine Learning algorithms within the system to forecast crop yields accurately.
- Systematically collect and store data on various factors influencing crop growth to facilitate effective crop performance monitoring.
